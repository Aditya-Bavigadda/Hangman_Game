# Hangman_Game
## Introduction H2
This is a Hangman game created for a school project and it was a group task. Even though this is a simple project, this is my first project so don't expect too much. Everything uploaded here is made by me, and you will notice the history/science buttons don't work and that is because that is what the other group members need to do.
This was created in grade 10 (2021).
